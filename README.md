# Population genetic inference with Convolutional Neural Networks

This directory contains code for training and testing the neural networks described in this paper: _The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks in Population Genetic Inference_
by Lex Flagel, Yaniv Brandvain, and Daniel Schrider. https://doi.org/10.1101/336073

Each folder contains the code and README files for a separate problem discussed in the paper.  All code is presented as is and runs in python 2.7 unless stated otherswise. Code is specific to the problems described in the paper, but can be modified to address other problems in population genetics.
