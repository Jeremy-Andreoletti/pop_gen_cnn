This directory contains the results of our application of FILET to population genomic data from D. simulans and D. sechellia.

intro_regions_clustered_genes.bed: This BED file contains the coordinates of all clustered introgressed regions and any overlapping genes (see manuscript for a description of our simple clustering procedure: http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/31/170670).

*.preds files for each major chromosome arm: The first three fields of these tab-delimited .preds files are the coordinates for each 10 kb window included in the analysis; the fourth field is the number of sites in the window that were included in the analysis (i.e. not filtered due to poor data quality/repetitive sequence); the fifth field is the state predicted by FILET (0=no introgression; 1=introgression from dsech to dsim; 2=introgression from dsim to dsech); the remaining fields are FILET's posterior probabilities for these respective states. These posterior probabilities may not be extremely well calibrated, but they are useful for ranking candidate regions.

For the .preds and .bed files the coordinates follow the bed convention of subtracting 1 from the starting position for some position, but using the correct end position. (i.e. the first 10 bp on chr2L is: chr2L    0    10). Note that the intro_regions_clustered_genes.bed file does not include any information about the direction of introgression, but you can pluck that information out from the .preds files.

Note: these analyses were performed on the March 2012 version of the D. simulans assembly constructed by Tina Hu and colleagues. The version on FlyBase has changed very slightly, so the coordinates will be slightly off. Later on this week I will add a version of intro_regions_clustered_genes.bed with coordinates lifted over to the current version of the assembly found on FlyBase.
